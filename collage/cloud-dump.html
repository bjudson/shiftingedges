            <p><a href="https://poetryarchive.org/poem/crusoe-england/">My island seemed</a> to be<br />
                a sort of cloud-dump. All the hemisphere’s<br />
                left-over clouds arrived and hung<br />
                above the craters—their parched throats<br />
                were hot to touch.<br />
                Was that why it rained so much?<br />
                And why sometimes the whole place hissed?<br />
                The turtles lumbered by, high-domed,<br />
                hissing like teakettles.<br />
                (And I’d have given years, or taken a few,<br />
                for any sort of kettle of course.)<br />
                The folds of lava, running out to sea,<br />
                would hiss. I’d turn. And they’d prove<br />
                to be more turtles.</p>

            <aside>
                I remember having been much <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1228/1228-h/1228-h.htm#chap09">struck 
                when viewing volanic islands</a>, which have been worn by the waves 
                and pared all round into perpendicular cliffs of one or two thousand feet in height; for the gentle
                slope of the lava-streams, due to their formerly liquid state, showed at a glance how far the hard, 
                rocky beds had once extended into the open ocean. The same story is told still more plainly by faults, 
                those great cracks along which the strata have been upheaved on one side, or thrown down on the other, 
                to the height or depth of thousands of feet; for since the crust cracked, and it makes no great 
                difference whether the upheaval was sudden, or, as most geologists now believe, was slow and effected 
                by many starts, the surface of the land has been so completely planed down that no trace of these vast 
                dislocations is externally visible.

            <p>Opal and Jacquie’s mom never let them kill a spider if they found one in the house, or anywhere else for that matter.
                Her mom said spiders carry <a href="https://www.kqed.org/arts/13835114/tommy-oranges-novel-there-there-is-a-gripping-portrait-of-oakland">miles of web</a> 
                in their bodies, miles of story, miles of potential home and trap. She said that’s what we are. Home and trap.

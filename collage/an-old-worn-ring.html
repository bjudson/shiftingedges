            <p>From all the hills came screams. A piece of sky beside the crescent sun was detaching. It was a loosened circle of evening sky, 
                suddenly lighted from the back. It was an abrupt black body out of nowhere; it was a flat disk; it was almost over the sun. 
                That is when there were screams. At once this disk of sky slid over the sun like a lid. The sky snapped over the sun like a 
                lens cover. The hatch in the brain slammed. Abruptly it was dark night, on the land and in the sky. In the night sky was a 
                tiny ring of light. The hole where the sun belongs is very small. <a href="https://home.ubalt.edu/ntygfit/ai_05_mapping_directions/ai_05_see/ad_total_eclipse.htm">A thin ring of light marked its place</a>.
                There was no sound. The eyes dried, the arteries drained, the lungs hushed. There was no world. We were the world's dead people rotating and orbiting 
                around and around, embedded in the planet's crust, while the earth rolled down. Our minds were light-years distant, forgetful 
                of almost everything. Only an extraordinary act of will could recall to us our former, living selves and our contexts in matter 
                and time. We had, it seems, loved the planet and loved our lives, but could no longer remember the way of them. We got the light 
                wrong. In the sky was something that should not be there. In the black sky was a ring of light. It was a thin ring, an old, thin 
                silver wedding band, an old, worn ring. It was an old wedding band in the sky, or a morsel of bone. There were stars. It was all 
                over.</p>

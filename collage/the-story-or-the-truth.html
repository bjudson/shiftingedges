            <p>My husband believed that I had treated him monstrously. This belief of his could not be shaken: his whole world depended on it. 
                It was his story and lately I have come to hate stories. If someone were to ask me what disaster had befallen my life, I might
                ask them if they wanted <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Aftermath/khxOpy8es5wC?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=truth&pg=PT7&printsec=frontcover">the story or the truth.</a>

                    then, is maintained not by imposition but by interpellation, by the confluences of shared relationships, 
                    shared discourses, institutions, and knowledge. Foucault called the practices that produce knowledge and keep knowledge in 
                    circulation an episteme: a set of rules and conceptual tools for what counts as factual. Such practices are exclusionary. 
                    They function in part to establish distinctions between those statements that will be considered true and those that will 
                    be considered false. Or factual rather than speculative. Or just rather than unjust.</p>

            <p>In the meantime I am listening to a story<br />
                about a salesman and somebody’s daughter<br />
                the story goes that the salesman <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueqMm_1Ao-Y">learned his lesson</a><br />
                and now he lives in the country like he oughta<br />
                <br />
                I laugh when someone tells a joke<br />
                but I always keep my mind on you<br />
                or am I just a fool to keep believing<br />
                that the map which you gave me was true?</p>

            <p>On the evening of May 31st, I was busy with a class in 
                Typewriting until about 9 P. M. After my pupils were 
                gone I immediately began reading a book which I was very 
                anxious to finish (must admit, however, that I was never 
                able to complete it), so did not notice the excitement until 
                a late hour. The evening being a pleasant one, my little 
                girl had not retired, but was watching the people from the 
                window. Occasionally she would call to me, “Mother, look 
                at the cars full of people.” I would reply, “Baby, do not 
                disturb me, I want to read.” Finally she said, “Mother, I 
                see men with guns.” <a href="https://archive.org/details/events-of-the-tulsa-disaster/">Then I ran to the window and looked 
                out</a>. There I saw many people gathered in little squads 
                talking excitedly. Going down stairs to the street I was 
                told of the threatened lynching and that some of our 
                group were going to give added protection to the boy.

            <p>66 Signs of Neon exists on several levels as an art exhibition dominated by <a href="http://www.noahpurifoy.com/66signs">assemblages 
                of artifacts of the Watts riots</a> (August 1965); as a one-to-one format of communication between individuals who otherwise 
                would not or could not communicate; as an evolving system of philosophy. It began as an expression of the necessity for art education, 
                affirming the importance of this avenue of self-expression to individuals in the community of Watts. Noah Purifoy and Judson
                Powell began with six assemblages created from the lead drippings of melted neon signs, artifacts of the riots.</p>

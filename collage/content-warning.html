                <p>It is tricky because different instances responded differently with their moderation policies, however, the 
                    <a href="https://zirk.us/@shengokai/109585637621322960" title="Mastodon thread">overall effect</a> was that white users and moderators would 
                    increasingly treat the experiences of users of color as "politics" and thus demand that they were censored or hidden under 
                    content warnings.
                <p>This had the effect of sanitizing the experiences of users of color across instances on the fediverse, and thereby preserving 
                    white comfort by treating race as "politics" and not "experience."

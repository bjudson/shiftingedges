                <br />
                Imagined in the dawn cold when it cried?<br />
                Where does it roost at last? On dungy sticks<br />
                In a jackdaw’s nest up in the old stone tower<br />
                <br />
                Or a marble bust commanding the parterre?<br />

                <p>We’ve since learned that the spectacular collective behavior of flocking birds (and schooling fish, herding mammals, swarming insects, and human crowds) is self-organized, emerging from simple rules of interaction among individuals. Birds are not “transfusing thought,” communicating telepathically with their flock members to act in unison, as Selous surmised. Instead, each bird is interacting with up to seven close neighbors, making individual movement decisions based on maintaining velocity and distance from fellow flock members and copying how sharply a neighbor turns, so that a group of, say, four hundred birds can veer in another direction in a little over half a second. What emerges is almost instantaneous ripples of movement in what appears to be <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Genius_of_Birds/gjRSDgAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&bsq=What%20emerges%20is%20almost%20instantaneous%20ripples%20of%20movement%20in%20what%20appears%20to%20be%20one%20living%20curtain%20of%20bird.">one living curtain of bird</a>.

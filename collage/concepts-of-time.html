            <p>I envy <a href="https://yhancik.tumblr.com/post/137271009763/hayao-yamaneko-was-more-meaningful-i-was-very">Hayao</a> 
                in his ‘zone,’ he <a href="https://www.markertext.com/sans_soleil.htm">plays with the signs of his memory</a>. 
                He pins them down and decorates them like insects that would have flown beyond time, and which he could contemplate from 
                a point outside of time: the only eternity we have left. I look at his machines. I think of a world where each memory 
                could create its own legend.</p>

            <p>He wrote me that only one film had been capable of portraying impossible memory—insane memory: Alfred Hitchcock’s Vertigo. 
                In the spiral of the titles he saw time covering a field ever wider as it moved away, a cyclone whose present moment 
                contains motionless the eye.</p>

            <p>In San Francisco he had made his pilgrimage to all the film’s locations: the florist Podesta Baldocchi, where James 
                Stewart spies on Kim Novak—he the hunter, she the prey. Or was it the other way around? The tiles hadn’t changed.</p>

            <p>He had driven up and down the hills of San Francisco where Jimmy Stewart, Scotty, follows Kim Novak, Madeline. It seems 
                to be a question of trailing, of enigma, of murder, but in truth it’s a question of power and freedom, of melancholy 
                and dazzlement, so carefully coded within the spiral that you could miss it, and not discover immediately that this 
                vertigo of space in reality stands for the vertigo of time.</p>

                <p>For performance in a railway station.</p>
                <p>The performers enter a railway station and obtain time-tables.</p>
                <p>They stand or seat themselves so as to be visible to each other, and, when ready, start their stopwatches simultaneously.</p>
                <p>Each performer interprets the tabled time indications in terms of minutes and seconds (e.g. 7:16 = 7 minutes and 16 seconds). 
                    He selects one time by chance to determine the total duration of his performing. This done, he selects one row or column, 
                    and makes a sound at all points where tabled times within that row or column fall within the total duration of his performance.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.mjt.org/exhibits/delson/sonabend.html">Sonnabend</a> believed that long term or "distant" memory was illusion, 
                but similarly he questioned short term or "immediate" memory. On a number of occasions Sonnabend wrote, 
                "<a href="https://www.mjt.org/exhibits/delson/oblisci.html">there is only experience and its decay</a>" by which he meant to suggest 
                that what we typically call short term memory is, in fact, our experiencing the decay of an experience. Interestingly, however, 
                Sonnabend employed the term true memory, to describe this process of decay which, he held, was, in actuality, not memory at all.</p>

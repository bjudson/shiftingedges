            <p>He said that in the 19th century, mankind had come to terms with space, and the great question of the 20th was 
                the coexistence of different concepts of time.</p>

            <h2><a href="https://www.moma.org/collection/works/156543">TIME-TABLE MUSIC</a></h2>

            <p>For performance in a railway station.</p>
            <p>The performers enter a railway station and obtain time-tables.</p>
            <p>They stand or seat themselves so as to be visible to each other, and, when ready, start their stopwatches simultaneously.</p>
            <p>Each performer interprets the tabled time indications in terms of minutes and seconds (e.g. 7:16 = 7 minutes and 16 seconds). 
                He selects one time by chance to determine the total duration of his performing. This done, he selects one row or column, 
                and makes a sound at all points where tabled times within that row or column fall within the total duration of his performance.</p>
            <p>George Brecht<br />
            Summer, 1959</p>

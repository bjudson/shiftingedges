            <p>One idea <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/57327/one-train-may-hide-another">may hide another</a>: Life is simple<br />
                Hide Life is incredibly complex, as in the prose of Gertrude Stein<br />
                One sentence hides another and is another as well. And in the laboratory<br />
                One invention may hide another invention,<br />
                One evening may hide another, one shadow, a nest of shadows.</p>

            <aside>Frequently, the organization of the system reflects the sprawl and history of the organization that built it 
                (as per CONWAY’S LAW [<a href="http://laputan.org/pub/papers/processpatterns.pdf" 
                title="A Development Process Generative Pattern Language">Coplien 1995</a>]) and the compromises that were made 
                along the way. Renegotiating these relationships is often difficult once the basic boundaries among system elements 
                are drawn. These relationships can take on the immutable character of “site” boundaries that Brand 
                [<a href="https://openlibrary.org/works/OL823146W/How_Buildings_Learn" title="How Building Learn (OpenLibrary)">Brand 1994</a>] 
                observed in real cities.

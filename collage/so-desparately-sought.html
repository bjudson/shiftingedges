            <aside>
                <p>There was a mirror in that apartment, ornate and gilded, that was so large it reflected the looker not as the center of the 
                image but as part of a greater scene. To be reflected in it was to be seen in proportion to other things. The loss of the 
                mirror was like the loss of a compass or a navigation point. It was surprising how deeply it had bestowed a feeling of 
                orientation. Sometimes a minor change can bring down a major structure, and this was the case with the lady’s apartment. 
                After we left, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/04/24/the-stuntman-fiction-rachel-cusk">a number of things happened</a> 
                whose roots could be found there.</p>

            <p>Behind each mirror<br />
                is a dead star<br />
                & a baby rainbow<br />
                sleeping.<br />
                <br />
                Behind each mirror<br />
                is a blank forever<br />
                & a nest of silences<br />
                too young to fly.<br />
                <br />
                <a href="https://teachersandwritersmagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Joanna-Fuhrman-inside-poems-handout.pdf">The mirror is the wellspring</a><br />
                become mummy, closes<br />
                like a shell of light<br />
                at sunset.<br />
                <br />
                The mirror<br />
                is the mother dew,<br />
                the book of desiccated<br />
                twilights, echo become flesh.</p>

                <p>All of us know, whether or not we are able to admit it, that <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Fire_Next_Time/lNYwEAAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&bsq=mirrors%20can%20only%20lie" title="Google Books">mirrors can only lie</a>, that death by drowning 
                    is all that awaits one there. It is for this reason that love is so desperately sought and so cunningly
                    avoided. Love takes off the masks that we fear we cannot live without and know we cannot live within.</p>

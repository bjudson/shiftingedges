            <p>Rose, so cherished by our customs,<br />
                dedicated to our dearest memories,<br />
                <a href="the-roses-xxv.html">become almost imaginary</a><br />
                for being so linked to our dreams—<br />
                <br />
                silent while becoming air, rose<br />
                eclipsing all the canticles,<br />
                that is triumphant in the rose<br />
                window, and between two lovers dies.<br />
            </p>

            <aside><p>Sometimes nature skips completely over the organ of the calyx, as it
                were, and goes directly to the corolla. We then have the <a href="https://maypoleofwisdom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/the-metamorphosis-of-plants.pdf">opportunity
                to observe</a> how stem leaves turn into petals. Thus, for example, an
                almost fully formed and colored petal often appears on tulip stems.
                It is even more remarkable when half of this leaf is green and attached
                as part of the stem, while its other, more colorful half rises up as part
                of the corolla, thereby dividing the leaf in two.</p></aside>

            <p>There’s rosemary, <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Plays_of_William_Shakspeare_In_Fifte/t5oNAAAAQAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PA275&printsec=frontcover">that’s for rememberance</a>.<br />
                Pray you, love, remember. And there is pansies,<br />
                that’s for thoughts.</p>

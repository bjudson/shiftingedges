            <p>Fire leaves its soul where it steps<br />
                clinging to its spent fuel<br />
                shadows in its wake as it follows<br />
                its hunger and the dry wind<br />
                <br />
                what follows fire but us<br />
                and flowers that dot the charred earth<br />
                after long slumbering in the soil<br />
                sprouting only at the scent of smoke<br />

Even painted figures or designs on pottery are improved by passing through fire. Pottery has a great advantage in its ability to draw in this way on the power of nature. Paintings, on the other hand, being "un-processed," are not able to make use of that source of power. Only when a thousand years or so pass, and a painting is very ancient, does it acquire a becoming patina that increases its beauty and intrinsic value. This, too, is the power of nature, which explains why all old things are correspondingly more attractive.</p>

                <p>Although the continuity for a film is all worked out in advance, that sequence may not necessarily be the most interesting way to shoot the picture. Things can happen without warning that produce a startling effect. When these can be incorporated in the film without upsetting the balance, the whole becomes much more interesting. This process is similar to that of a pot being fired in a kiln. Ashes and other particles can fall onto the melted glaze during the firing and cause unpredictable but beautiful results. Similarly unplanned but interesting effects arise in the course of directing a movie, so I call them “<a href="https://akirakurosawa.info/akira-kurosawa-quotes/kurosawa-quotes-directing">kiln changes</a>.”</p>

# shiftingedges.com

This is the repo for the <a href="https://shiftingedges.com">my personal website</a>. Right now, it is built using <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev/">SvelteKit</a>, and deployed using <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>. Most of the site is basic professional info, links, the normal stuff.

## hypertext collage

There is one section of the site that is more unique. The <a href="src/routes/collage">hypertext collage</a> conceptually combines snippets from poems, essays, stories, song lyrics, along with images of artworks and movie stills. Within the collage, there is no attribution or context, but everything links out to another site with more information about the original source. This is a space where I find connections between things I'm reading, watching, and thinking about. It's my <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history">digital garden</a>.

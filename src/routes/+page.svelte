			Hi, I’m a software engineer who cares about craft and collaboration. I build software that
			supports healthy engagement with creative culture.
		</p>
		<p>
			For the past few years, I’ve been working to create excitement about literature with <a
				href="https://literati.com/">Literati</a
			>, and am currently leading development of an internal service that informs intelligent
			curation of books.
		</p>
		<p>
			Before joining Literati, I built <a href="https://www.lingoapp.com/">Lingo’s web app</a> for
			<a href="https://thenounproject.com/">Noun Project</a>. Lingo is a tool used by design teams
			at LinkedIn, SalesForce, Workday, Headspace and many others to manage and distribute their
			design systems. Before we launched Lingo, I worked on Noun Project’s
			<a href="https://thenounproject.com/search/?q=origami"
				>international, crowdsourced icon marketplace</a
			>, which (at the time) was used by more than a million designers every month.
		</p>
		<p>
			I cut my teeth as an independent contractor building content management systems for artist
			portfolios in San Antonio. This led to contracts as the sole engineer building the primary web
			sites for Blue Star Contemporary Art Museum, Trinity University Press, and David Shelton
			Gallery. A couple of these sites were in production for over a decade.
		</p>

			>.
		</p>
		<p>
			I’ve organized some <a href="http://heavydenim.org/past.html"

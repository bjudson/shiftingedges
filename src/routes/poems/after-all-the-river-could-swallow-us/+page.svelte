<Poem>
  After all the river could swallow us <br />
  not whole but bit by bit <br />
  like the stones beneath our feet <br />
  <br />
  but if instead it swallowed the heavy <br />
  air between us we could see <br />
  each other without light without <br />
  <Link href="because-of-the-eye-the-hand-fell">eyes that build distance</Link> upon
  drought <br />
  without words that <Link href="your-breath-has-buried"
    >push us from the earth</Link
  > <br />
  from the froth and the spray of weight <br />
  <br />
  after all the <Link href="a-river-hides-the-earth"
    >river is neither earth</Link
  > <br />
  nor sky but their violent <br />
  <Link href="a-bird-was-given-the-heart">marriage at our feet</Link>
</Poem>

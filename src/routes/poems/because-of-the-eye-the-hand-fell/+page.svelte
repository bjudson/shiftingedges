<Poem>
  Because of the eye the hand fell<br />
  apart into countless waves<br />
  which pushed the <Link href="scratching-the-moon-into-earth"
    >fingers of the sun</Link
  > back and forth<br />
  along the skin until the skin couldnâ€™t<br />
  any longer<br />
  contain life or <Link href="the-bird-slowly-grew-a-fear"
    >keep out the world</Link
  >
</Poem>

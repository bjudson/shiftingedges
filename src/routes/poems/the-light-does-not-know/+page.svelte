<Poem>
  The light does not know <br />
  what we need <br />
  <br />
  the light sinks down trying <br />
  to build a <Link href="the-weight-of-your-eyelids">center in the world</Link
  ><br />
  <br />
  the world doesnâ€™t need a center <br />
  the grass holds it together <br />
  at the edges the tips reaching <br />
  <Link href="scratching-the-moon-into-earth">for the wind</Link> the roots
  <br />
  strangling the light
</Poem>

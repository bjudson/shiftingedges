<Poem>
  I dreamed that<br />
  <Link href="when-there-is-space-we-will-meet">my hand was like yours</Link> that<br
  />
  <Link href="because-of-the-eye-the-hand-fell">hands are not hands</Link><br />
  without <Link href="the-light-does-not-know">their empty centers</Link><br />
  where death becomes water<br />
  where birds build the horizon<br />
  out of eyelashes that fell<br />
  from closing eyes<br />
  <br />
  I dreamed that<br />
  my fist pushed like a heart<br />
  and the air became blood

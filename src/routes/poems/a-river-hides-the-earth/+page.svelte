<Poem>
  A river hides the earth<br />
  beneath <Link href="long-strands-of-light">a false sky</Link><br />
  composed of shifting edges<br />
  and <Link href="the-light-does-not-know">shattered light</Link><br />
  <br />
  the earth is glad to be free<br />
  but the sky resents<br />
  being its mask<br />
</Poem>

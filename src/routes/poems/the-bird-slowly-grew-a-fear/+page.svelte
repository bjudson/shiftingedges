<Poem>
  The bird slowly grew a fear<br />
  that its heart would cut away<br />
  the fabric making trees<br />
  <Link href="when-there-is-space-we-will-meet">understand their roots</Link><br
  />
  making us <Link href="i-dreamed-that">understand death</Link><br />
  making every wave mimic<br />
  the ocean floor<br />
  forgetting <Link href="fire-leaves-its-soul-where-it-steps"
    >the moon and the wind</Link
  ><br />
  it spills over the face<br />
  of the world
</Poem>

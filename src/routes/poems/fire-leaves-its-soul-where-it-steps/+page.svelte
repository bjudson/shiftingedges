<Poem>
  Fire leaves its soul where it steps<br />
  clinging to its spent fuel<br />
  <Link href="when-there-is-space-we-will-meet">shadows in its wake</Link> as it
  follows<br />
  its hunger and the dry wind<br />
  <br />
  what follows fire but us<br />
  and flowers that <Link href="scratching-the-moon-into-earth"
    >dot the charred earth</Link
  ><br />
  after long slumbering in the soil<br />
  rising only at the scent of smoke<br />
</Poem>

<Poem>
  Your <Link href="when-there-is-space-we-will-meet">breath has buried</Link><br
  />
  words deep in the earth<br />
  <br />
  they will <Link href="fire-leaves-its-soul-where-it-steps">rest there</Link
  ><br />
  until the earth falls<br />
  apart into <Link href="long-strands-of-light">countless waves</Link><br />
  <br />
  then with nothing above<br />
  or beneath them<br />
  these <Link href="because-of-the-eye-the-hand-fell"
    >words will be the skin</Link
  ><br />
  that contains life<br />
  and keeps out the world

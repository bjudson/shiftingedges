<Poem>
  Long <Link href="the-light-does-not-know ">strands of light</Link><br />
  cling to the grass<br />
  feeding memory a fruit<br />
  that <Link href="the-weight-of-your-eyelids">weaves fabric</Link><br />
  between the roots and earth<br />
  between each fading footstep<br />
  and the slowly turning sky<br />
  a fabric that fills fading days<br />
  with sunlight and waves
</Poem>

<Poem>
  The weight of your eyelids<br />
  turned the world against me<br />
  as <Link href="after-all-the-river-could-swallow-us">the air left</Link><br />
  in search of a song<br />
  <br />
  the parting of your lips<br />
  had lost its meaning<br />
  <br />
  breath turned to distance<br />
  hair to long strands of light<br />
  that <Link href="the-bird-slowly-grew-a-fear">set about weaving fabric</Link
  ><br />
  between the roots and the earth<br />
  between the heart and the world
</Poem>

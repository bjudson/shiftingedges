<Poem>
  When there is space we will meet<br />
  <Link href="i-dreamed-that">our hands between us</Link> our eyes swollen<br />
  <br />
  this same water pushing across the earth<br />
  this same weight inhabiting our feet<br />
  but <Link href="after-all-the-river-could-swallow-us"
    >an air less visible</Link
  ><br />
  a breath less burdened<br />
  by clinging leaves and stones<br />
  unaware of the surface stones<br />
  washing through shadows<br />
  through the ashes gathering in the corner<br />
  the <Link href="a-bird-was-given-the-heart">birds searching for breath</Link
  ><br />
  but <Link href="long-strands-of-light">drowning in light</Link><br />
  <br />
  when our eyes have forgotten us<br />
  when the shadows have been set free<br />
  we will meet
</Poem>

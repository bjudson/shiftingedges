<Poem>
    <Link href="the-bird-slowly-grew-a-fear">A bird was given</Link> the heart<br />
    of a tree and flew<br />
    until the lakes fed the clouds<br />
    and the waves dried<br />
    their feet on the hot sand<br />
    <br />
    the bird pulled a branch<br />
    from its heart and landed<br />
    on a fruit without seeds<br />
    <br />
    there was no bird only<br />
    world only seed and rain<br />

<Poem>
  Scratching <Link href="the-bird-slowly-grew-a-fear">the moon into earth</Link
  ><br />
  letting the wind consume it<br />
  steeping deeper past the stars<br />
  as the moon clips and folds away<br />
  <br />
  woe to the sun cutting<br />
  things into more dust<br />
  woe to time slipping<br />
  <Link href="the-weight-of-your-eyelids">between the heart and the world</Link>
</Poem>

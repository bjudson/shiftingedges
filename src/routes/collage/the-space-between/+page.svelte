      We came round in the end to a discussion of this dream that she had
      reported at the beginning (<a

    I want to slay the space between sky and land<br />
    I want to slay everyplace except where Mommy is lying<br />
    <br />
    I want to slay the rain falling like a black velvet curtain<br />
    I want to slay the geraniums under the drops of moonlight<br />

    Why did you let Mommy be born?<br />
    And why do you let her die?<br />
    <br />
    I can’t take off my birdcage dress<br />

      was <em>formlessness</em>, which is what the material is like before it is
      patterned and cut and shaped and put together. In other words, in a dream
      this would be a comment on her own personality and self-establishment.

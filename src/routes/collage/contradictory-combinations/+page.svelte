		In addition to being represented by their own records, such so-called “attributes” can exhibit
		another characteristic property of entities (or relationships): they themselves might be the
		subject of some information (like intersection data). Thus, the intersection records required to
		list the children of employees might include their birthdays; the intersection records listing
		the colors of multi-colored cars might include the percentage of a car’s surface covered by a
		given color. To summarize, consider the contradictions in the following assertions:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Every record represents an entity.</li>
		<li>Every entity is represented by a distinct record.</li>
		<li>All relationships are entities.</li>
		<li>Some relationships are not represented by distinct records.</li>
		<li>The “subject” of an attribute is an entity.</li>
		<li>Some attributes are the subjects of other attributes.</li>
		<li>Attributes are not entities.</li>
		<li>Some records represent attributes (and nothing else).</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		<a href="/data-and-reality.pdf">You play the game</a>. See how many contradictory combinations
		you can find.
	</p>
	<p>
		Then decide which of those assertions you’re willing to give up in order to achieve consistency.

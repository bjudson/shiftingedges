    On the evening of May 31st, I was busy with a class in Typewriting until
    about 9 P. M. After my pupils were gone I immediately began reading a book
    which I was very anxious to finish (must admit, however, that I was never
    able to complete it), so did not notice the excitement until a late hour.
    The evening being a pleasant one, my little girl had not retired, but was
    watching the people from the window. Occasionally she would call to me,
    “Mother, look at the cars full of people.” I would reply, “Baby, do not
    disturb me, I want to read.” Finally she said, “Mother, I see men with
    guns.” <a href="https://archive.org/details/events-of-the-tulsa-disaster/"
      >Then I ran to the window and looked out</a
    >. There I saw many people gathered in little squads talking excitedly.
    Going down stairs to the street I was told of the threatened lynching and
    that some of our group were going to give added protection to the boy.

    66 Signs of Neon exists on several levels as an art exhibition dominated by <a
      href="http://www.noahpurifoy.com/66signs"
      >assemblages of artifacts of the Watts riots</a
    > (August 1965); as a one-to-one format of communication between individuals
    who otherwise would not or could not communicate; as an evolving system of philosophy.
    It began as an expression of the necessity for art education, affirming the importance
    of this avenue of self-expression to individuals in the community of Watts. Noah
    Purifoy and Judson Powell began with six assemblages created from the lead drippings
    of melted neon signs, artifacts of the riots.

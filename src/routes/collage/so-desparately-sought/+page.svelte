      There was a mirror in that apartment, ornate and gilded, that was so large
      it reflected the looker not as the center of the image but as part of a
      greater scene. To be reflected in it was to be seen in proportion to other
      things. The loss of the mirror was like the loss of a compass or a
      navigation point. It was surprising how deeply it had bestowed a feeling
      of orientation. Sometimes a minor change can bring down a major structure,
      and this was the case with the lady’s apartment. After we left, <a

    I think of the friends<br />
    Who came to see me, of what yesterday<br />
    Was like. A peculiar slant<br />
    Of memory that intrudes on the dreaming model<br />
    In the silence of the studio as he considers<br />
    Lifting the pencil to the self-portrait. <br />
    How many people came and stayed a certain time, <br />
    Uttered light or dark speech that became part of you <br />
    Like light behind windblown fog and sand, <br />
    Filtered and influenced by it, until no part <br />
    Remains that is surely you. Those voices in the dusk <br />
    Have told you all and still the tale goes on <br />
    In the form of memories deposited in irregular <br />
    Clumps of crystals. Whose curved hand controls, <br />
    Francesco, the turning seasons and the thoughts <br />
    That peel off and fly away at breathless speeds<br />
    Like the last stubborn leaves ripped <br />
    From wet branches?

    > <br />
    Of your round mirror which organizes everything <br />
    Around the polestar of your eyes which are empty,<br />
    Know nothing, dream but reveal nothing.

      All of us know, whether or not we are able to admit it, that <a

      reason that love is so desperately sought and so cunningly avoided. Love
      takes off the masks that we fear we cannot live without and know we cannot
      live within.
